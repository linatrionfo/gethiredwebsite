            <p> Hi! My name is Adelina Trionfo, and I design, build, and maintain websites. I was born in Provo, Utah. I am a senior at Riverton High School. I love playing violin, guitar, and drums, going to school events, especially football games, and dancing my heart out. I am passionate about bringing goodness and joy to the world, and I spend a lot of time doing little things, like making 100 valentines to hand out on Valentine’s day, in order to accomplish that. I’m currently in a program learning front end web development, so I am in charge of updating the Riverton Career and Technology Education website. I am the marketing officer for DECA and FBLA, primarily running promotions on and editing videos for social media. I am also president of SkillsUSA at the Jordan Academy for Technology and Careers. I won the Riverton High School Service Award and belong to the National Honor Society and the Computer Science Honor Society. My goal in life is to pursue entrepreneurial ventures to enrich my life and the lives of those around me. To this end, I plan to get a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a minor in business. 
            </p>
